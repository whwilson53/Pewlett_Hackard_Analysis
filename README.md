# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis
## Overview ##
This analysis is an extension of exploratory work done for management with company employee data newly organized into the structured data tables. 
These asks help put numbers around recent employee concerns in regards to pace of retirement and mentorship eligibility.

## Results ##
- Key Takeaways
  1. the retirement_titles document contains a subset of all employee data where employee birth date fell in a date range determined to be retirement prone. There were over 130,000 records queried here.

  2. The 'unique titles' analysis narrowed the data toward the question of retirement total in order to create a list that could be better summarized. There are about 72,000 records here as it cuts duplicate employee records and filters out those that have already retired. We have about 72,000 employees that are prone to retirement. 

  3. The 'retiring titles' doccument analyses the data at the title level - counting the result table created prior into a new summary table. 

  4. There are just over 1,550 employees eligible for the mentorship program.
  
  -Summary
    *Over 72,000 employees are prone to retirement.These rolls will need to be filled but the mentorship program contraints will need to be expanded as that provides only about 1,500 mentors to assist with filling these slots if a mentor-mentee ratio is 1:1.
